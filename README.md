# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repository contains run_analysis.R, tidy.txt, and a codebook.
In the run_analysis.R, the follow steps are processed:
- Download and unzip the dataset
- create test and train datasets and merge them together 
- extract mean and standard deviation
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- creates a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
